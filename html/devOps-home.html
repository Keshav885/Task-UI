                    <h3>Release Management</h3>

                    Life Before DevOps… Bob had to be involved in every release. Dev teams had scripts they wanted and engineers need VMs to be provisioned and/or configured.
                    Life After DevOps… VM provisioning and configurations are automated through config management recipes or scripts that are embedded with each code deployment, so Bob doesn’t get pulled into the tactical fire drills for releases.

                        <h3>Monitoring Production Apps</h3>

                        <p>Life Before DevOps… Bob has multiple apps that are in production that he is responsible for once they go live. He is reactive to issues in the environment because they don’t appear on his radar before then.
                            Life After DevOps… Because ops participated early in the process and he’s tracking the app from dev stage, Bob has insight into the potential performance issues from the outset and has been able to mitigate many of them, working with the developers.

                            Simply put, DevOps is a combination of software development and operations—and as its name suggests, it's a melding of these two disciplines in order to emphasize communication, collaboration, and cohesion between the traditionally separate developer and IT operations teams.

                        Life Before DevOps… New servers are being added by engineering all of the time. He may or may not know when they are added, but he sure is responsible for the performance of the environments.
                        Life After DevOps… Automated scaling allows for new servers to be provisioned and configured. If he has a solution like Vistara, they’re automatically discovered and managed according to the rules he’s set, whether they are in dev, test or production.
